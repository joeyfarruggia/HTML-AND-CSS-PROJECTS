	<h1>The Thrill of the Challenge</h1>
	<p>When you get to the rifle range, with your new rifle in hand, and a full box of ammo, you get the feeling of butterflies in your stomach.
	You set your rifle up, get out your rangefinder, figure out how far your target is, and get prepared.</p>
	<h3>The First Shot</h3>
	<p>You find your target in your scope. You slow down your breathing to a calm steady pace. You have adjusted your scope to shoot correctly, and
	it's time. Your finger is resting on the trigger, you let out a breath, and you pull it.</p>
	<h6>The payoff</h6>
	<p>The trigger goes off. You hear the crack of the rifle through your ear pro, and you stay locked in, focusing on your target. You listen for it, 
	that sound of the bullet striking the metal plate that is too far away to see with the naked eye. All of a sudden... You hear the ping. Shot made.</p>
